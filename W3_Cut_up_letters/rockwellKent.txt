Frances, I am so lonely I can hardly bear it. As one needs happiness so have I needed love, that is the deepest need of the human spirit. And as I love you utterly, so have you now become the whole world of my spirit. It is beside and beyond anything that you can ever do for me, it lies in what you are, dear love. To me so infinitely lovely that to be near you, to see you, hear you, is now the only happiness, the only life, I know. How long these hours are alone. Yet is good for me to know the measure of my love and need, that I may at least be brought to so govern myself as never to lose the love and trust that you have given me. Dear Frances, let us make and keep our love more beautiful than any love has ever been before.
