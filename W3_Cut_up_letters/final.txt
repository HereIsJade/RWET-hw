I read the whole fucking thing, that I may at least be brought to so govern myself as never to lose the love and trust that you have given me.
It's been a long road since then, let us make and keep our love more beautiful than any love has ever been before.
You're obviously a bright fucking chick, I am so lonely I can hardly bear it.
Of course,How long these hours are alone.
Thank you for your gorgeous and charming letter, that is the deepest need of the human spirit.
I was very miserable and fighting hard on my 21st b' day, so have you now become the whole world of my spirit.
People booed me on the stage, to see you, hear you, is now the only happiness, the only life, I know.
So hang on, it lies in what you are, dear love.
