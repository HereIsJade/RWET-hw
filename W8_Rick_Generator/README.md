# Rick Generator

### Inspiration: Tv series [Rick And Morty](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/)

The plot goes like this: mad scientist Rick Sanchez is constantly snatching his grandson Morty out of his day-to-day life to play assistant on adventures that range from cross-galaxy and universe travel via Rick’s portal gun to an experimental amusement park built inside a homeless man.

Rick is a classic nihilist, or at least externally so, and he shows open contempt for just about everyone around him, family included, as he drinks and belches and slobbers his way through adventure after adventure. Rick is an absolute genius but is pretty high on the evil scale so he’ll do the right thing, but only when it benefits him the most.

I am inspired by his words that a lot of which shows Absurdism philosophy. So I wanted to create a simple Rick Simulator or Generator using Markov chain to invent some sentences that Rick might say.

The source texts are scrapped from [fandom](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(TV_series) by each episode. I still need to work on manipulating the source texts later, such as splitting each "Rick says" chunk by period for better markov chain performance.
