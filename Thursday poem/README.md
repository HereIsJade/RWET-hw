# Thursday poems

<p>Then I remembered that it's Thursday</p>
<p>It's always Thursdays</p>
<p>Sometimes Thursdays have been fine</p>
<p>But when a day of the week hasn't been fine,</p>
<p>It's been a Thursday</p>
<p>Thursdays should be good</p>
<p>It's a Thursday<p/>

<p>Nothing special, to me its Thursday</p>

<p>Your chords on Saturday afternoons,</p>
<p>your hugs on Sunday morning,</p>
<p>your smiles on Monday chats,</p>
<p>your kisses on Thursday nights</p>
