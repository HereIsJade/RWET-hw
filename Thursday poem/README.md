# Thursday poems

Then I remembered that it's Thursday
It's always Thursdays
Sometimes Thursdays have been fine
But when a day of the week hasn't been fine,It's been a Thursday
Thursdays should be good
It's a Thursday

Nothing special, to me its Thursday

Your chords on Saturday afternoons,
your hugs on Sunday morning,
your smiles on Monday chats,
your kisses on Thursday nights
